early_ioremap()/early_memremap() and early_iounmap() provide a mechanism for
temporarily mapping in small blocks of memory, identified by their physical
address, into the fixmap virtual address block before paging_init() has run
and more flexible mapping functions are available.

Due to its direct method, it also gets around potential need for special
handling of regions that end up in highmem.

It supports up to 7 simultaneously mapped regions of up to 128KB each.
All mappings created by early_ioremap() are non-shareable device memory.
All mappings created by early_memremap() are uncached normal memory.

Any residual mappings will be overridden by subsequent kmap() calls (but do
use early_iounmap()).

Specify 'early_ioremap_debug' on the kernel commandline for verbose output.

SYNOPSIS
	#include <asm/io.h>

	void *early_ioremap(resource_size_t phys_addr, unsigned long size);
	void *early_memremap(resource_size_t phys_addr, unsigned long size);
	void early_iounmap(void *addr, unsigned long size);
