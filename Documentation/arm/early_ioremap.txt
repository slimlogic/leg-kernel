early_ioremap() and early_iounmap() rovide a mechanism for temporarily mapping
in small blocks of memory, identified by their physical address, into the
fixmap virtual address block before paging_init() has been called and more
flexible mapping functions are available.

Due to its direct method, it also gets around potential need for special
handling of regions that end up in highmem.

It supports up to 7 simultaneously mapped regions of up to 128KB each.
All regions are mapped as non-shareable device memory.

Specify 'early_ioremap_debug' on the kernel commandline for verbose output.
